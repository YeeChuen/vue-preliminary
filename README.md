# vue-preliminary

Vue-preliminary is an exercise project aimed at learning Vue.js. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I am now transitioning to Vue.js to broaden my web development skills. This project serves as a practical application of my existing knowledge, allowing me to explore the nuances and capabilities of Vue.js.

The project includes multiple custom components and pages such as basic counter, todolist, pages and much more. Each designed to leverage specific aspects of web development and to learn Vue.js. This includes and not limited to:

- Options API vs Composition API
- Vue state management
- Data binding(forms, html props, etc)
- Vue router(Routing)
- Vue event handling
- Pagination
- Vue custom components
- Through Vue-preliminary, I aim to connect my existing knowledge with Vue.js, thereby enhancing my ability to build robust and scalable web applications. This project not only helps in understanding the core

concepts of Vue.js but also in applying advanced techniques such as custom directives, mixins, and Vue's lifecycle hooks to create a comprehensive and interactive web experience.

Note: Vue-preliminary is not optimize for mobile view.
